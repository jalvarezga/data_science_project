problem with this rout is that when it gets triggered,  this is a common problem with maintaining state across form submissions in Flask apps.
When you:

Upload the CSV → Everything works fine (table and histogram options show up).

Click "Show Histogram" → It renders the histogram, but the table is gone.

✅ Why This Happens
Each Flask route is stateless by default, meaning:

When you post to /show_histogram, it only knows what you explicitly send in the form.

You're not passing first_rows (i.e., the HTML table of the first few rows) in your histogram form submission.

So Flask can't re-render that part of the interface unless you re-calculate and send it again.



def show_histogram():
    file_path = request.form['file_path']
    column_name = request.form['column_name']
    color = request.form['color']
    df = read_csv(os.path.join(UPLOAD_FOLDER, file_path))
    img_str = plot_histogram(df, column_name, color)

    return render_template('index.html',
                           success=True,
                           filename=file_path,
                           column_names=df.columns.tolist(),
                           histogram_img=img_str,
                           column_name=column_name,
                           color=color)
